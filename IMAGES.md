# Tools To Deal With Container Images

## Base images

### Distroless 1.0

<a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless">distroless</a> - "Language focused docker images, minus the operating system" _aka_ "scratch for everyone else." Read <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/containers-distroless-images/">my overview of the distroless project on iximiuz.com</a>.

### Chainguard Images

<a href="https://github.com/chainguard-images">Chainguard Images</a> - "A collection of container (OCI) images designed for minimalism and security." Many of them are distroless and contain only an application and its runtime dependencies. Typically, there is no shell or package manager. Images building procedure is designed to be reproducible and declarative (see **apko** and **melange** below).

## Image Build Tools

### ‚≠ê BuildKit

<a href="https://github.com/moby/buildkit">BuildKit</a> - "concurrent, cache-efficient, and Dockerfile-agnostic builder toolkit."

### ‚≠ê Docker buildx plugin

<a href="https://github.com/docker/buildx">buildx</a> - "Docker CLI plugin for extended build capabilities with BuildKit." The plugin provides the familiar `docker build`-like UX but on top of a more powerful build engine (BuildKit). It also includes a tool called <a href="https://github.com/docker/buildx/blob/master/docs/reference/buildx_bake.md">bake</a> that allows building all the images in an application together and let the users define project specific reusable build flows. In other words, _bake_ is a container-aware _make_.

### Buildah

<a href="https://github.com/containers/buildah">Buildah</a> - "A tool that facilitates building OCI images."

### kaniko

<a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko">kaniko</a> - "Build Container Images In Kubernetes."

### ü™¶ makisu

<a href="https://github.com/uber-archive/makisu">makisu</a> - [discontinued] "Fast and flexible Docker image building tool, works in unprivileged containerized environments like Mesos and Kubernetes."

### ‚ö†Ô∏è img

<a href="https://github.com/genuinetools/img">img</a> - "Standalone, daemon-less, unprivileged Dockerfile and OCI compatible container image builder." Might be abandoned.

### ko

<a href="https://github.com/ko-build/ko">ko</a> - "Build and deploy Go applications on Kubernetes."

### Jib

<a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib">Jib</a> - "Build container images for your Java applications."

### Packer

<a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/packer">Packer</a> - "A tool for creating identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration." Packer is primarily focused on producing virtual machine images but it also allows building Docker, LXC, and LXD images using a similar to VM-provisioning procedure (read, by putting shell commands into a HCL file).

### Cloud Native Buildpacks

<a href="https://github.com/buildpacks">Cloud Native Buildpacks</a> - "Transform your application source code into images that can run on any cloud."

### apko

<a href="https://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko">apko</a> - "Build OCI images using APK directly without Dockerfile." A tool to produce minimalistic container images that include only the needed packages.

### melange

<a href="https://github.com/chainguard-dev/melange">melange</a> - "Build APKs from source code". A complimentary tool for apko.

### Chisel

<a href="https://github.com/canonical/chisel">Chisel</a> - an early-day project by Canonical. Similar idea to **apko** and **melange** but on top of the Ubuntu base. Read this <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-6-is-now-in-ubuntu-2204/">Microsoft devblog article about large(r) scale application of Chisel for producing _.NET on Ubuntu_ images</a>.

### Nixery

<a href="https://github.com/tazjin/nixery">Nixery</a> - "Docker images on the fly with Nix". A Docker-compatible container registry that transparently builds images using the Nix package manager.

### Devbox

<a href="https://github.com/jetpack-io/devbox">Devbox</a> - "Instant, easy, predictable shells and containers." Devbox is a command-line tool that lets you create isolated shells and containers. You start by defining the list of packages required by your development environment, and Devbox uses that definition to create an isolated environment just for your application. You can use it right away, or turn it into a OCI container image. No Dockerfiles are involved. Powered by Nix.

### buildg

<a href="https://github.com/ktock/buildg">buildg</a> - "Interactive debugger for Dockerfile, with support for IDEs (VS Code, Emacs, Neovim, etc)."
